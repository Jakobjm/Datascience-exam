loading the KAZ_moundattributes and VisibleID to pick out the visible mounds to create bounding boxes for training the U-Net model later.
```{r}

                                                  max_dim <= 40 ~ "medium",
                                                  TRUE ~ "large"
                                                  )
                                                  )  #inner join to only pick the ones in the visible list, then find the maximum dimension for each, and bucket                                                        them according to that.


```


for each mounds I now make a bounding box of different dimensions for each size bucket. 
this is to make sure the background doesn't completely drown the signal in noise for the small and medium mounds.
these will be used to fine tune different heads on a U-Net segmentation model (together with patches of similar sizes without mounds in them)



generate bounding boxes.
```{r}
#####################################
# SETTING THE BUFFER SIZES, THESE CONTROL THE SIZE OF THE BOUNDING BOXES FOR SMALL/MEDUIM/LARGE MOUNDS
#####################################
buffer_sizes <- c(6,24,78) #these are set at 20% bigger than the threshold and for large mounds 20% bigger than 130 which is the max dimension of the largest mound
#this makes the mounds (assuming they are circular) fill at max ~71% of the area and the minimum would be ~21% for a mound that just makes the large category.
#the idea is that having some background around the mound is good for training the segmentation model, but if the mound is only a tiny part of the image, it will learn
#background noise instead. 
#thresholds are x<=10,x<=40,40<=x, where x is the largest dimension of the mound, for small/medium and large respectively.
```
